Why have one method for creating a swap chain when you could have six:

D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain
IDXGIFactory::CreateSwapChain
IDXGIFactory1::CreateSwapChain
IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForHwnd
IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCoreWindow
IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForComposition

There are also two Present functions:

IDXGISwapChain::Present
IDXGISwapChain1::Present1
